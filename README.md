# Results
Looking at the image below we can see there are five criterias that the table can provide.
A customer can filter the information based on the city,state, country, date,and size.
In order to gather insight on this data, we will pick a state to look into to give users an understanding of how this webpage functions.

Once entering the website our client will see the basic opening and title with the picture at the top, as the client scrolls down they will begin to see all the data and filters that we have(which is in the image below). From this image below we have 5 different filters to choose from; the date, city, state, country & shape. You can choose any of these filters enter the search bar, then the HTML page will show all of the sightings for that specific search. Multiple filters can be entered at the same time to further inspect the data in the specific search bar that is entered.
