# Results
Looking at the image below we can see there are five criterias that the table provides.
A customer can filter the information based on the city, state, country, date, and size.
To gather insight on this data, we will pick a state to look into how this webpage functions.

 we can choose any of the filters to enter the search bar, then the HTML page will show all of the sightings for that specific search. Multiple filters can be entered at the same time to further inspect the data in the specific search bar that is entered.

# Summary
The main purpose of this project is to create a dynamic website that can give in-depth information analysis of UFO sightings. The page has different criteria that can be filtered at the same time. However, the page can still be improved and has a room to grow. For instance, it is case-sensitive this can be improved for future. To develop the webpage and make it more vibrant we can include more filters and we can also fix the problem it has now for future redevelopment.
